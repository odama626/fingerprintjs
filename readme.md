FingerprintJS is a browser fingerprinting library that queries browser attributes and computes a hashed visitor identifier from them. Unlike cookies and local storage, a fingerprint stays the same in incognito/private mode and even when browser data is purged.

This repository is a fork of FingerprintJS that was originally licensed under the MIT License. It has been rereleased as `@sparkstone/fingerprintjs` under the same MIT license.

## Installation

You can install `@sparkstone/fingerprintjs` using your preferred package manager:

### pnpm

```sh
pnpm add @sparkstone/fingerprintjs
```

### npm

```sh
npm install @sparkstone/fingerprintjs
```

### yarn

```sh
yarn add @sparkstone/fingerprintjs
```

## Quick start

Here is a basic TypeScript example of how to use FingerprintJS:

```typescript
import FingerprintJS from '@sparkstone/fingerprintjs'

// Initialize the agent at application startup.
const fp = await FingerprintJS.load()

// Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
const result = await fp.get()

// This is the visitor identifier:
console.log(result.visitorId)
```
