FingerprintJS is a browser fingerprinting library that queries browser attributes and computes a hashed visitor identifier from them. Unlike cookies and local storage, a fingerprint stays the same in incognito/private mode and even when browser data is purged.

This repository is a fork of FingerprintJS that was originally licensed under the MIT License. It has been rereleased as `@sparkstone/fingerprintjs` under the same MIT license.

## Quick start

```html
<script>
    // Initialize the agent at application startup.
    const fpPromise = import('https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v3').then((FingerprintJS) => FingerprintJS.load())

    // Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
    fpPromise
        .then((fp) => fp.get())
        .then((result) => {
            // This is the visitor identifier:
            const visitorId = result.visitorId
            console.log(visitorId)
        })
</script>
```
